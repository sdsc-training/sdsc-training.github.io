One of the largest technical meetings in HPC in the world is the annual Supercomputing Conference (https://supercomputing.org ). 
SC supports many student activities, including the Student Cluster Competition (http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/).  SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing.  Student teams must learn to design and build small clusters  with support form hardware and software vendor partners, learn designated scientific applications, apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures. At the SC conference, teams of 6 students compete against teams from all over the world, in a non-stop, 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, keep the cluster up and running on their own( without help from mentors/teachers), attending conference events, and demonstrating to the judges their HPC knowledge and skills. Acceptance to the SC competition is competitive and requires intense preparation and skill development. 
<p>
This year, SDSC is excited to announce that HPC Students will begin training UCSD students to participate in its Student Cluster Competition Program (and other potential HPC activities). Our goal is to successfully apply to be a team at the SCC’19 competition, to be held in Denver this Fall. 
Students selected for the team will travel to the meeting, and all expenses will be paid by the HPC Students Program and sponsors.
Note: this will be an annual activity, with future opportunities including sponsoring a team for the ISC High-Performance Computing meeting during Summer 2020 (https://www.isc-hpc.com/). 

<p>
Although participation on the team is limited to undergraduates, participation in the HPC Training Program is open to UCSD undegraduate and graduate students. <br>

For 2019, our training activities will include the following key steps: 

<h3>Step 1: <a href="https://training.sdsc.edu/scc-training-schedule">HPC Training Schedule for 2019</a> (Spring quarter): </h3> We have planned a series of 9-10 training sessions, to be held on Fridays from 1:00pm to 3:00pm in the SDSC SynCenter, or the Auditorium.  Students who successfully complete the HPC Training program will receive an SDSC Certificate of Completion in HPC Training, and will become eligible to apply to be on the SCC Core team. Note: the final SCC team who will travel to the competition will be chosen from this group.
<p>
<h3>Step 2: Summer HPC Cluster Buildout:  </h3>
Once the training sessions have been completed, a group of the top students (appx 20) who have completed 
  the program will be selected to work on the SCC core team. The team will work throughout the Summer to build out and admin an HPC cluster (on loan to SDSC for the competition) and start training on the science applications

<h3>Step 3: SCC Team Finalization (August): </h3>
The final 6 (plus alternates), who will travel to the meeting, will be chosen from the SCC core group. 
Core team memebers must commit to traveling to SCC in Denver, CO,  from Saturday, 11/16/19 to Friday, 11/22/19. Note: all team members will be participating in preparing for the actual meeting.
