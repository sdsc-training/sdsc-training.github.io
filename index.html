# Training for Advanced Computing Users
This GitHub repo will provide materials to support SDSC training classes and workshops.
These events will introduce new and current users to the high performance computing, data, and 
visualization resources available at SDSC and provide the programming skills necessary to use SDSC 
resources effectively and efficiently. Workshops offer experienced users more in-depth instruction, 
including hands-on assistance with their own codes and collaborative discussions with other 
users and parallel computing experts
