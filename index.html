Training classes and workshops introduce new and current users to the high performance computing, data, and visualization resources available at SDSC and provide the programming skills necessary to use SDSC resources effectively and efficiently. Workshops offer experienced users more in-depth instruction, including hands-on assistance with their own codes and collaborative discussions with other users and parallel computing experts.
